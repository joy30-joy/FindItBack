# FindItBack

FindItBack is a full-stack web app I made to help people report and find lost or found items around them. If someone loses something or finds something that doesnâ€™t belong to them, they can post it here with details like title, description, and location. Others can search and filter through the listings to see if their item was found or if they can help return something.

## Features

- Post lost or found items with location, status, and description
- Search by keywords or filter by status (Lost/Found)
- View full item details in a modal
- Mark items as resolved or remove listings when needed

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js, Tailwind CSS, React Router, Axios
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Mongoose
- **Other Tools**: dotenv for environment variables, CORS config
